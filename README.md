# SAS-Customer-Purchase-Behavior
A customized data model that helps predicting customer purchase behavior for a bookstore (Barnes & Noble) using supervised machine learning techniques. 
The following files have been uploaded with the project:

books.txt: Data Set containing records of customer purchases at two competitors i.e. Amazon.com and BARNES & NOBLE (courtesy: Prof. Syam Menon).

gProj.sas: SAS file containing the customized model code to predict the purchasing behavior. There are other parameters and calculations that have been made inside the code as well. A short explanation for each procedure espcially where log likelihood is calculated is mentioned in the comments.

gProj.docx: Files with explanations on procedures and outcomes that might act as effective solutions.

A major chunk of the work for this project is finished, although I'm still looking to optimize and come up with a better solution to this project and I'm also open to comments and suggestions
